# MedicalArzi
This is my first github repository for the medical arzi project.

This project is started as a pilot for the Dawoodi Bohra community to address their
medical conditions by submitting the arzi for Doa Mubarak or Raza Mubarak from 
His Holliness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin (TUS), the 53rd Dai-ul-Mutlaq of the strong
Dawoodi Bohra faith.
